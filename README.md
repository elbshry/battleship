# Backend Challenge :rocket:
Welcome to the coding challenge :wave:

## Your challenge

### User Story
As someone who likes games, I want to have a little game which I can play with a friend by taking turns at the keyboard, so that we can amuse ourselves.

### Description
We have slightly different expectations depending on what the level is of the position you are applying for - you'll find explicit directions in the README that applies to you.

### Questions?
